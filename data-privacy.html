    <h3>Data Protection</h3>
    <p>The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
    <p>When you interact with us (e.g., through email or GitHub), various personal data is collected. Personal data is data that can be used to personally identify you. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.</p>
    <p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>
    <h3>Information on the Controller</h3>
    <p>The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>
    <p>
      Andreas Tennert<br>
      D-01728 Bannewitz
    </p>
    <p>Email: <a href="mailto:lcarsde@andreas-tennert.de">lcarsde@andreas-tennert.de</a></p>
    <p>The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>
    <h3>Storage Duration</h3>
    <p>Unless a more specific storage period has been specified within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.</p>
    <h3>General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on this Website</h3>
    <p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data according to Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest, according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information about the relevant legal bases in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.</p>
    <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
    <p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only transfer personal data to external parties if this is necessary for the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the transfer according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the data transfer. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract for order processing. In the case of joint processing, a contract for joint processing is concluded.</p>
    <h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
    <p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke the consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
    <h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
    <p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
    <p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION ACCORDING TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>
    <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
    <p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work, or the place of the alleged violation. This right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>
    <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
    <p>You have the right to receive data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract, either for yourself or to have it transferred to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.</p>
    <h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time regarding this and other questions about personal data.</p>
    <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time regarding this. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you contest the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
      <li>If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
      </li>
      <li>If you have filed an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from its storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.</p>
    <h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
    <p>For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
    <p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transfer to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
    <h2>4. Data Collection on this Website</h2>
    <h3>Inquiry by Email or Telephone</h3>
    <p>If you contact us by email or telephone, your inquiry, including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of handling your request. We will not share this data without your consent.</p>
    <p>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR if your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of inquiries addressed to us (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
    <p>The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g., after we have completed processing your request). Mandatory legal provisions – in particular legal retention periods – remain unaffected.</p>
