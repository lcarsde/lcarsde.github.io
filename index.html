      <h2>What is LCARS Desktop Environment?</h2>
      <p><strong>LCARS Desktop Environment</strong> or short <strong>lcarsde</strong> is an open source desktop environment for Linux systems. The main goal for this project is to create a desktop experience that looks somewhat like a LCARS interface.</p>
      <p>The desktop environment consists of a window manager that is based on Xlib as well as a set of tool applications, which are a menu of active open applications, the status bar, a program selection and an application for logout, shutdown, etc.</p>

      <p>Releases 21.2 of lcarswm and status-bar are out.

      <p>We adjusted this websites font for headers and the navigation. Ubuntu Condensed did a good job but we took the chance to switch to LCARS GTJ 3. This font is made to look like the font in the TNG series. This font is created and provided by GTJ LCARS, whose link you can find on the links page. We hereby give our thanks to GTJ LCARS for this font and hope you enjoy the updated look.</p>
      <p>We look forward to use this font in lcarsde as well.</p>

      <p>Firstly, let us wish you a happy, blessed new Year 2021. Stay healthy!</p>
      <p>We enjoyed a little break, that we used to solve Advent of Code puzzles as well as relax and enjoy some time with the close family.</p>
      <p>Now we are back and for lcarsde this year will start with a rewrite of the status-bar application. That will bring more stability and get rid of two serious bugs. The next things on the schedule will be the fixing of a lcarswm bug and the creation of build packages for Debian/Ubuntu.</p>
